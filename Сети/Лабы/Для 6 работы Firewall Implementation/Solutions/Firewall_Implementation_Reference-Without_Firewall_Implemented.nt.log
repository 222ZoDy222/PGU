0	867	Campus Network.Building_Subnet.CISCO PIX Firewall	Results	RIP	Performance	SYMPTOM(S): <NL>  1. No RIP routing updates past a certain <NL>  simulation time. <NL>  2. Lower than expected throughput or <NL>  utilization of the links. <NL>   <NL> CAUSE(S): <NL>  "RIP Sim Efficiency" simulation attribute <NL>  is set to "Enabled". <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL>  Set "RIP Sim Efficiency" simulation <NL>  attribute to "Disabled". <NL>  
5.0004228186	4561	Campus Network.Building_Subnet.70 Users Floor 1	Protocol	UDP	Packet Drop	SYMPTOM(S): <NL>  Discarding UDP datagram received (destined <NL>  for port number: 520) <NL>   <NL>  It is typical for end nodes (e.g., wkstn <NL>  and servers) to discard datagrams containing <NL>  RIP messages (i.e., port 520) and LDP (Label  <NL>  Distribution Protocol, port 646) messages.   <NL>  In that case, this message can be ignored. <NL>   <NL> EFFECT(S): <NL>  1. The datagram is discarded by the UDP. <NL>  2. Application data may not be received. <NL>  3. No Effects if the datagram was received <NL>     for port 520 and node is not using RIP. <NL>  4. No Effects if the datagram was received <NL>     for port 646 and node is not MPLS enabled. <NL>   <NL> SUGGESTIONS: <NL>  Make sure that the applications are <NL>  sending packets to a port that UDP <NL>  is listening on. <NL>   <NL>  This message will not be repeated. <NL>

3600	1980746	N/A	Config.	Event Manager	Performance	Try setting the 'event_speed_parameter' preference to (712515). <NL>   <NL> The advanced event management system in the Simulation <NL> Kernel can be tuned to maintain peak performance when <NL> simulating very large systems. Your trade-off is that <NL> higher values of event_speed_parameter require <NL> additional memory. <NL>   <NL> Optimal values depend on the type and size of models, <NL> so the value above is an estimate based on how this <NL> simulation performed. You may wish to experiment <NL> with different values and compare the simulation's <NL> performance. In general, increasing this parameter <NL> will not yield significant performance gains for small, <NL> lightly-loaded systems. <NL>
